# Superfastboot Usage Guide


## Booting

- Temporarily boot an EFI file (without flashing):

  ```bash
  fastboot boot xxx.efi
  ```


## Bootloader (BL) Related

- Lock the BL **data wipe**:

  ```bash
  fastboot flashing lock
  ```

- Unlock the BL **without data wipe**:

  ```bash
  fastboot flashing unlock
  fastboot flashing unlock_critical
  ```

> Note: If the TEE status is inconsistent, the device will refuse to provide the data key, causing data access failure.


## Flashing

- Flash an image to a partition:

  ```bash
  fastboot flash <partition> <file.img>
  ```

- Erase a partition:

  ```bash
  fastboot erase <partition>
  ```

  ```bash
  fastboot reboot bootloader
  ```

- Reboot into recovery mode; next normal boot enters recovery:

  ```bash
  fastboot reboot recovery
  ```

- Normal reboot of device:
